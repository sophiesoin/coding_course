    <center><h1> Rico The Penguin! </h1></center>
    <center><img src="rico.png" width="175px"></center>
    <center><h3> Rico is the head of demolition and quartermaster for the Penguins. His first appearance is in Madagascar; he is a supporting character in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted and one of the main characters of Penguins of Madagascar: The Movie.
In the first three movies Rico was almost indistinguishable from Skipper, but in the TV series was given scruffy feathers on his head and a visible scar on the left side of his beak, the origin of which has never been revealed. It is shown in A Christmas Caper, which would have taken place before the movies, but does not appear in the movies. He also became taller, fatter, and developed a double chin.
In the fourth Madagascar movie, Rico is made more distinguishable from Skipper by having a tuft of slicked-back feathers on his head, as well as being taller and fatter. He also had a chip in his beak, but this was on the right side of his face. It is unknown how he got this scar either.
Rico holds a variety of items in his gut, which is a virtual 'hammerspace' as many of those items are bigger than him. While inside his digestive system, Mort finds a spiral staircase and an elevator. In "The Big S.T.A.N.K.," he choked up an air-to-ground missile and launching platform. In "The Red Squirrel," it was a ringing payphone.
Unlike the other Penguins, Rico usually babbles and mumbles rather than speaking actual words (though his speech has improved steadily since Season 2). Rico also cries very much like an infant (as seen on "Smotherly Love," "What Goes Around," and more).
